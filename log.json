      "comment": "Completed most of the backend except invitations and advertisements. Should be a quick addtion. Need to concentrate now on the front end structure. The auth app needs to cope with an admin creating an account to create a club. He will then bulk add users via an interface that will notify them via email. The users will then navigate to a link in that email with a key that uniquely identifies them against the record from the admin. Users will fill in their personal details and have the option to request roles within the club and to request to join other clubs. A user can also sign up directly and request to join clubs without an admin adding them via email.",
